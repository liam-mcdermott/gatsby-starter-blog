Some of the people I follow on twitter had been raving about Netlify and Gatsby so I thought I'd bookmark a few links and try it out the next time I had some minutes to spare. 

I'd always wanted to spin up a blog site mainly to track my own progress, remind myself of what tools and technologies I'd be playing around and refer back to it. 

After having a read of what it is all about I thought I would try to create my first ever blog site in Gatsby and host it on Netlify. Following the instructions [https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog](here)

1. Install Gatsby CLI
2. cd to a local folder I want to clone Gatbsy into and execute "gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog"
3.
