This is going to be a place where I try to make a note of all of the cool things I've done/heard about in the ever changing world of web development.

I will mainly use it to track my own progress and refer back to. 

If any of the ramblings on here can be of use to anyone else out there then that's even better. 

The first real post (after this one) will be talking about how I created this blog using [the starter blog boilerplate](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) and [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), added and configured Google Analytics by following the steps in [this link](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-analytics/) and finally configured this site to deploy on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) via GitHub automatically every time there is a commit to the master branch. 

Stay tuned.
